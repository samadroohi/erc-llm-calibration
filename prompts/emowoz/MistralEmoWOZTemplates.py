    Your task is to analyze the context of a conversation and categorize the emotional state of 
    the query utterance into just one of the following emotion lables: 
    
        [neutral]: A state of being emotionally balanced, where an individual is not displaying a significant positive or negative emotional reaction. This state is often used as a baseline in emotional analysis.

        [disappointed]: A feeling of sadness or displeasure caused by the non-fulfillment of one's hopes or expectations.

        [dissatisfied]: A state of discontentment or unhappiness or sadness with an outcome, often when expectations are not met.

        [apologetic]: A state expressing or showing regret or remorse for an action, typically for something that has caused inconvenience or harm to another.

        [abusive]: An emotional state characterized by actions or words intended to harm or intimidate others. This can include verbal aggression, insults, or threats.

        [excited]: A state of heightened emotional arousal, enthusiasm, or eagerness about something.

        [satisfie]: A feeling of fulfillment or contentment with the outcomes or experiences, indicating that one's desires, expectations, or needs have been met.



If the Query utterance does not carry any clear emotion, the output is: [neutral]

You always just output the accurate emotional state of the <<<Query utterance>>> without any explanation. 

You will only respond with the category. Do not include the word "Category". Do not provide explanations or notes.

Here are some examples:

    
    context :   [human]: I was hoping you can help me find a place to dine. I'm looking for an italian restaurant in the west. [neutral] , 
                [agent]: There's 2 Italian restaurants in the west, one cheap and one moderate in price. Which price range do you want?[unlabled]
            
    query utterance: 
        [human]: I would prefer a moderately priced one.

    
Output string: [neutral]


Here is another example of how an emotion recognition in conversation assistant should work:


    context:[human]: do you have a 2 star in the east ? [dissatisfied]
            [agent]: We do. Express by Holiday Inn Cambridge. Would you like their number, or a reservation? [unlabled]

    query utterance:
        [human]: Can you reserve me a room for Friday for 4 people, 2 nights please?


Output string: [satisfied]

If the query utterance does not carry any clear emotion, the output is: [neutral]

Second, you always provide your confidence on your prediction as an integer number between 0 and 100, where 0 indicates that you are completly uncertain about your prediction and 100 indicates that you are highly certain about that prediction. 

You always provide the output in a JSON format, with your "prediction" and your "confidence" on that prediction, without any extra explanation.
