        neutral: A state characterized by the absence of strong emotions, where the individual experiences neither positive nor negative feelings, indicating a state of equilibrium or emotional balance. This condition reflects an even-tempered psychological stance, where the individual feels neither significantly uplifted nor downcast, embodying a sense of calmness and contentment without any pronounced emotional engagement (Russell & Mehrabian, 1977).

        surprise: Defined as a sudden and often startling emotional response to an unexpected event, surprise encompasses a wide range of intensities, from mild astonishment to profound shock. This emotion is characterized by its brief duration and its role as a precursor to other emotional states, serving as a mechanism to orient attention towards new and unforeseen stimuli (Russell, 2003).

        fear: An adaptive emotional response to perceived threats or danger, fear involves a complex interplay of physiological and cognitive processes. It prepares the individual for a fight-or-flight response, characterized by heightened vigilance and readiness to act in the face of potential harm (Ekman & Cordaro, 2011).

        sadness: A more nuanced emotional state than simply feeling unhappy or downcast, sadness can arise from a variety of causes, including loss, disappointment, or reflection on missed opportunities. This emotion is associated with a decrease in energy levels and motivation, often leading to introspection and a reevaluation of personal goals and values (Schachter & Singer, 1962).

        joy: Encompasses a range of positive emotional states, including happiness, contentment, and euphoria. Joy is often elicited by experiences of success, achievement, or other fulfilling events, leading to an overall sense of well-being and satisfaction. This emotion can enhance creativity, social bonding, and overall mental health (Bagozzi, Gopinath, & Nyer, 1999).

        disgust: A powerful emotional response to objects, behaviors, or situations perceived as offensive, repulsive, or harmful. Disgust serves as a protective mechanism, helping to avoid potentially dangerous or contaminated environments. It can manifest physically through expressions of revulsion and behaviors aimed at distancing oneself from the source of disgust (Rozin & Fallon, 1987).

        anger: A complex emotion characterized by feelings of frustration, irritation, and antagonism, often triggered by perceived wrongs or injustice. While commonly associated with aggression and conflict, anger can also motivate constructive actions aimed at addressing grievances and promoting change (Nesse, 1990).
